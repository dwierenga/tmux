RETIRED in favor of https://github.com/dwierenga/dotconfig


My personal tmux configuration.  It's stored in ~/.tmux for ease of storing in Git without conflicting with any other dotfiles repo.

Add this as your ~/.tmux.conf file:
`source ~/.tmux/conf`

For status bar to render properly, you'll want to use a font that supports certain Unicode glyphs.  If you don't already have a favorite font that supports the icons,
I recommend the [Hack font](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/).
